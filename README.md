## Laberinto
This is my entry for the 2013 GitHub Game-off! (and my first-ever entry at any competition of this sort)
My -extremely creative- take on the theme "change" is a labyrinth game in which the controls change in a predictable -and predictably annoying- way.
I was aiming for something simple and yet challenging, but I'm not so sure I quite managed to deliver on that. Curiously enough, several friends who tested it want me to add a countdown to make it even more challenging, but I've put that feature on hold so as to not completely annoy the general audience.
All things considered, I think this thing's got potential, so I'll look into turning it into a full fledged game and release it commercially (this version of code will always be available for free of course! I want to thank whomever was responsible for setting this up, since otherwise I wouldn't have given myself the time to put this lil' game together :D ).
I'm only sad I started out too late and didn't have time to implement sounds and background music (and better graphics and menus and a bazillion things).

The game can be played here:

(refresh the page if it doesn't load, the server's free -000webhost- and so it fails some times)

# Controls
Either mouse click / touch on the directional buttons on screen or use the keyboard's arrows or WASD.

## About
It's entirely made with JavaScript using the open source framework Cocos2D-HTML5 (and the source I provide here requires it to be downloaded separately to work):
https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5/

The bulk of the coding was made on the open source editor Scripted:
https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted

And quick-fixes and lookups (as well as on-the-run coding) was done with Notepad++:
http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

The graphics were made by hand by me and scanned and edited with Paint.Net and Inkscape (albeit my poor graphic skills don't do either software justice):

http://inkscape.org/

The best mazes/labyrinths were generated with mazegenerator:

And then the actual tilemaps were edited with Tiled:

Thanks for your time!

PS: any and all feedback is of course appreciated @ZippoLag :D
