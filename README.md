## Laberinto

This is my entry for the 2013 GitHub Game-off! My -extremely creative- take on the theme "change" is a laberinth game in which the controls change in a predictable -and predictably annoying- way.

The game can be played here:
http://proto.heart-bit.com.ar/laberinto
(refresh the page if it doesn't load, the server's free -000webhost- and so it fails some times)

It's entirely made with JavaScript using the open source framework Cocos2D-HTML5:
https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5/

The bulk of the coding was made on the open source editor Scripted:
https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted

The graphics were made with Paint.Net and Inkscape:
http://www.getpaint.net/
http://inkscape.org/

Maps were edited with Tiled:

Thanks for your time!

PS: any and all feedback is of course appreciated on @ZippoLag :D
